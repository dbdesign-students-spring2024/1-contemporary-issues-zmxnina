# The Controversial Role of Clearview AI's Facial Recognition Technology in Criminal Investigation
As facial recognition software becomes increasingly pervasive in present society, it brings to the forefront a range of ethical concerns. This narrative unravels two opposing perspectives regarding the role Clearview AI's facial recognition technology plays in law enforcement and criminal investigation.

The New York Times article [Clearview AI, Used by Police to Find Criminals, Is Now in Public Defenders' Hands](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/18/technology/facial-recognition-clearview-ai.html) delves into the pivotal role Clearview AI's facial recognition technology played in exonerating an innocent man from vehicle homicide accusations.

Clearview AI, an American facial recognition company, markets a technology that combines facial recognition algorithms with a vast database of over 30 billion images sourced from the internet. The advantages of such software are readily evident, as it facilitates tasks ranging from locating missing children to apprehending vicious felons. With the advancement offered by Clearview AI, tasks that demanded extensive hours of manual labor - meticulous searches through repositories of photographs, biometric data, and other personally identifiable information - can now be completed in a fraction of the time at considerably lower expenses.

The firm primarily restricted its clientele to law enforcement agencies but granted exceptional access to public defenders representing Andrew Grantt Conlyn, accused of vehicular homicide. The prosecution accused Conlyn of being the negligent driver of the Ford Mustang involved in the fatal collision that had claimed his friend's life. Despite years of effort, Conlyn's legal team was unable to locate the crucial witness seen in police body camera footage asserting that Conlyn was a passenger in the vehicle while his friend was the driver. However, with Clearview AI's facial recognition technology, the team was able to identify matches in a matter of seconds, dismissing the charges raised against Conlyn. 

The case prompted Clearview AI to extend access to its facial recognition technology to public defenders in order to "balance the scales of justice."

## Article 2
Contrary to the claims presented in The New York Times account, The New Yorker article [Does A.I. Lead Police to Ignore Contradictory Evidence?](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/20/does-a-i-lead-police-to-ignore-contradictory-evidence) sheds light on the ethical concerns and negative publicity surrounding Clearview AI's facial recognition technology and it's application in law enforcement.

Owing to the lack of adequate regulation, law enforcement agencies often do not disclose their use of facial recognition technology to the public or the accused. A recent case involving Randal Quran Reid illustrates this issue, as he was arrested for credit card fraud based on a Clearview AI search. Unaware that a facial recognition search had implicated him as a suspect, Reid spent six days in jail, and his family incurred substantial legal expenses due to the misidentification. 

This instance represents just one of the numerous wrongful arrests resulting from Clearview AI misidentifications, fueling skepticism about the technology's reliability. Facial recognition algorithms are trained using an extensive dataset of facial photographs to construct statistical models for measuring image similarity. However, accuracy may fluctuate depending on the quality of the reference photo, which is susceptible to variations in lighting and angles. Moreover, if the dataset used to train the algorithm is imbalanced, the model's performance may suffer, especially for certain demographic groups. In a 2019 study conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, it was revealed that facial recognition technology was more prone to misidentifying Black and Asian faces, with error rates ranging from ten to a hundred times higher than those for Caucasian faces, aggravating racial disparities within the criminal justice system.
